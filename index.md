#### *What are the key functions of GitHub? Who are the users? Please use your own words to describe them (200 words – 300 words).*

Some of the key functions in Github include:
* git add 
* git commit -m “message”, 
* git push 
* git clone
* git branch
* git -am “message” 

The git add adds the changes you made into the working directory, and you’ll commit the change with a description with the git commit -m “” command, followed by pushing the changes to github with the git push command. Git clone adds the new or existing repo to your local machine so you can work on the repo and make the changes to files, and push them to the branch on github. Git branch allows you to create and switch between branches to make a “copy” of the main code and so you can not modify existing, working code with your changes. 
Branches allow for you to be experimental and to make changes without messing up working code. I like the git -am “” command as it combines the add and commit command into one command. 

From some quick research, the users of github range from small start ups to some of the biggest names in the tech world such as Airbnb, Netflix, Instacart, Robinhood, reddit, Lyft, etc. These are just a few examples of the type of users of github. Github allows for collaboration with group members working on a project and allows for multiple people to work at the same time, make changes and merge the additions seamlessly. It is a great way to do group coding projects and assignments either for personal, school, or work assignments. 

#### *What are the differences between “clone” and “pull request” in GitHub?*

The git clone command adds an existing or new repository to your local machine to be able to connect to the github repository so you can make changes. The pull request is basically connecting to github and pulling in the changes or updates that your partners have worked on. The pull request lets you stay up to date with all of the updates made in the files. 

#### *Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.*

[Data:](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/distribution-maps-of-amphibians-in-the-sierra-nevada)

Using this data set we could explore the expected life span and migration patterns of these 36 amphibians in the California Sierra Nevadas and predict the life expectancy of these animals and see if there's a pattern of a declining population. We could cross reference this data set potentially with pollution data or weather patterns to determine cause and effect. 

#### * Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book. *

The book I chose was [“R for Data Science,”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)  by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund, a free textbook designed to teach the reader useful ways to transform and visualize data using R. What interests me in the book is the easy to navigate sections and chapters. The book also teaches fundamental concepts of data science such as cleaning data and creating reproducible research.
